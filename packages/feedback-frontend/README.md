# `@hililabs/feedback-widget` (TypeScript / React)

React feedback widget: floating button, panel with multiple form types, redacted screenshot capture, admin triage page, ticket comments, magic-link landing pages.

Vendors its own shadcn/ui primitives — host doesn't need to ship them. Generates its own typed SDK from the package backend's OpenAPI.
